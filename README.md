> **This repository is archived.** I built this as a way to learn about web servers, nginx, graphql, api's, and http requests. However, it does not have much practical use. Thus, I have decided to freeze the project so it can be showcased as part of my portfolio.

Nautilus is a Public API/database holds Splatoon 2 profile data on users. Powered by Python, GraphQL, MongoDB, Flask, Ariadne, and Pydantic. Use this API with your discord bot to:
- Store user data without the need of your own database.
- Synchronize user data from anywhere, no matter the bot.

## Usage <!-- Using the project directly -->
_Documentation can me found [here](https://lepto.tech/nautilus-chambers/docs)._

```python
import requests

query = """
query {
  readProfile(discord: 0) {
    profile {
      status {
        gear {
          weapon {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
    errors {
      msg
    }
  }
}
"""

resp = requests.post(
  "https://nautilus.lepto.tech/graphql",
  json={'query': query},
  headers={"Authorization": "Bearer eyJhb...XVCJ9"}
)
```
